Generate camera movement videos for uni3c:https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/Uni3C
Uni3C is great for camera control with wan2.1, however, the controlnet requires a video input, their original method  to convert a pic to depth 
map and then to camera video, as I tested ,is not so convenient. So I created this repo to generate video movements.
to use:
Assuming you have installed python already
Download the repo and double click go.bat , the program will run in the browser.
